# The Factom Ecosystem
There are several primary components in the Factom ecosystem, as depicted below:

￼￼￼￼￼Once the system is set up, including issuance of Factoids (i.e., the cryptocurrency of Factom) and user accounts, token value is transferred among users, Factom, and Bitcoin with the following primary interactions:
1. Application Owner purchases Entry Credits with Factoid
2. Application records an Entry
3. Factom Servers create Entry Blocks and Directory Blocks
4. Factom secures an anchor (hash of the Directory Block) onto the blockchain
5.
Details of these and other interactions are in the upcoming sections.
